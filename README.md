## About This Project: 
Tasks is a to-do list application built to help me keep up to date on my daily tasks. I'm updating the project because the current version doesn't reflect my abilities as a developer any more. I decided to refactor the code utilizing protocols, and implementing methods that better reflect MVC. I built the views programatically on this version (previous version used Interface Builder).
